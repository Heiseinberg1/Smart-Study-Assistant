🧠 How the Multi-Agent System Works

Each agent is a separate Python class:

ExplainerAgent → explains concepts

QuizAgent → creates quizzes

SummarizerAgent → summarizes text

Chat Mode → interacts using PDF + memory + Google AI

Routing is handled inside app.py:

if mode == "Explainer Agent":
    response = ExplainerAgent(client).explain(user_input)

📄 PDF-Based Question Answering

When a user uploads a PDF:

✔ Extracts text
✔ Saves to memory
✔ Chat mode uses this for relevant answers

📝 Future Improvements (Roadmap)

🔹 Vector Embeddings (RAG) for smarter PDF search

🔹 Multiple PDF library support

🔹 User login / accounts

🔹 Cloud deployment (Render / GCP)

🔹 Voice input + TTS

🔹 Notebook mode (step-by-step explanations)
