            "content": "Okay, here's a summary of the Git cheat sheet PDF you uploaded:\n\n**Core Functionality:**\n\n*   **Staging and Snapshots:**  The cheat sheet covers commands for managing the staging area (where you prepare changes for a commit) and creating commit snapshots (saving the changes). Key commands include `git status`, `git add`, `git reset`, `git diff`, and `git commit`.\n*   **Setup and Initialization:** It provides commands to configure user information (name, email) for commit attribution and to initialize new Git repositories or clone existing ones (`git init`, `git clone`).\n*   **Branching and Merging:**  The document outlines commands for creating, listing, switching between, and merging branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`). Also included is `git log` for viewing commit history.\n\n**Collaboration and Updates:**\n\n*   **Remote Repositories:** It details how to connect to remote repositories, fetch updates, merge remote branches, and push local changes (`git remote add`, `git fetch`, `git merge [alias]/[branch]`, `git push`, `git pull`).\n\n**Advanced Operations:**\n\n*   **Tracking Path Changes:** Includes commands for removing files and tracking file moves/renames in the repository's history (`git rm`, `git mv`, `git log --stat -M`).\n*   **Temporary Commits (Stashing):** Explains how to temporarily save modified changes to a stack for later use using the stash (`git stash`, `git stash list`, `git stash pop`, `git stash drop`).\n*   **Rewriting History:**  Covers commands for rewriting commit history, such as rebasing and resetting (`git rebase`, `git reset --hard`).\n*   **Inspecting and Comparing:** Provides commands for examining logs, comparing branches, and viewing Git objects (`git log`, `git diff`, `git show`).\n*   **Ignoring Patterns:** `.gitignore` and `git config --global core.excludesfile` is mentioned\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*   **Installation and GUIs:**  It provides links to GitHub Desktop for Windows and Mac, as well as the official Git website for other platforms.\n*   **GitHub Education:** Highlights GitHub's free resources for students and teachers.\n"
